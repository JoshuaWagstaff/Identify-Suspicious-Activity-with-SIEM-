## Objective

We noticed some unusual activity in our SIEM. We want to find out where it is coming from and prevent attacks by blocking the sender. We do this through IP address block however there are some other attacks that cannot be blocked this way as they may use IP spoofing and quickly change ips.


### Skills Learned

understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.


### Tools Used

Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
AbuseIPDB, Cisco, Talos Intelligence
